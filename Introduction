Introduction
Health is the prerequisite of survival and development for human. One important indicator to measure health is life expectancy, defined as the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life (World Bank, 2019). China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion, had also set it an important goal to prolong citizens’ life expectancy in the 12th and 13th five-year plan. Specifically, the Chinese government aims at increasing citizens’ life to 79 years old in the outline of ‘Healthy China 2030’. In fact, almost every country tries to increase its citizens’ life expectancy and improve their life quality. Therefore, investigating and analyzing factors that affect life expectancy is meaningful and can help governments make decisions to better pursing developments and achieving goals. Meanwhile, it will spontaneously ensure and improve living standards. Considerable research has been done in this field for the reasons aforementioned. Linden and Ray (2017) suggested in their article that people live longer in countries with a higher GDP per capita. From the perspective of the medical area, average life could be increased by 1 year if the infant mortality rate decreases per 9‰ or 10‰ (Shen et al., 2015). Many researchers have investigated in this field, but few researchers have done multivariable analysis between life expectancy and macro factors. Therefore, in our study, we aim to find a relationship between life expectancy and demographic structure, economic development, medical treatment level, climate, and health conditions.
